<b>Catheter Ablation - risks</b><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The risks of this surgery are very minimal and unlikely. The main is a clot forming, this shouldn’t happen though as the patient has to be taking blood thinners for a period of time before surgery. If it does happen, the staff are trained to deal with it.<br/>
Another risk is the AV node and WPW pathway being in close proximity to one another. Sometimes in this case the AV node might be damaged when trying to ablate the WPW pathway. If this happens the heart will be fine; it will still keep beating as it’s being paced by one of the catheter leads. A pacemaker will be fitted to pace the heart after surgery. This may add limitations to your daily life. This possibility will be discussed with you by your surgeon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fluid buildup around the chest cavity can sometimes happen if the wall of punctured. In this case a line will be fed in and the fluid will be drained. <br/>
<br/>
Infection is always a possibility with any surgery, keep the wound area clean to avoid this.<br/>
<br/>
Death can never be ruled out of any surgery but the risk is incredibly low for this procedure.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Emergency treatment of WPW</b><br/>
If the dangerous heart rate fails to terminate by itself within, medical intervention is usually required. There are two main methods that is used in A+E to treat this:
<br/>* Drugs
<br/>* Cardioversion
<br/>
<br/>Drugs used to be seen as the first line of controlling a non-terminating WPW flare up, but in recent years this has become discouraged as research has found the medication to have adverse effects and in cases can make the situation worse.
<br/>
<br/>The safest and most effective emergency treatment is cardioversion. In Cardioversion, the patient is lightly sedated until they lose consciousness, conducting pads are placed onto the chest area and the heart is shocked into the correct heart rhythm. This method is quick and relatively painless due to the sedation. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>Treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White</b>
<br/>There are currently two main treatments of WPW; a drug that can suppress the effects of the excess pathways and Catheter ablation surgery which is more commonly adopted.
<br/>
<br/>The drug method is good at suppressing some cases of WPW, however the medication requires it to be taken every day and it’s not 100% effective in blocking all signals from going through these extra pathways so there is still the chance that you can have a flare up, it’s just that the likelihood is reduced. It’s effectiveness also depends on placement of the pathway in the heart, it’s conductivity and how many pathways there are.
<br/>
<br/>Catheter Ablation surgery is the most widely accepted and effective way of treating WPW. In the surgery, tiny probes are sent through the veins up into the heart where they then locate the problematic excess pathways and destroy them using concentrated radio frequency. If successful, the patient is left WPW free. However, it may take multiple surgeries depending on pathway location and how many pathways need to be destroyed.
<br/>The surgery is usually quite fast (around 2 hours) and patients can go home the next day.
