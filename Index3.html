Catheter Ablation - risks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The risks of this surgery are very minimal and unlikely. The main is a clot forming, this shouldn’t happen though as the patient has to be taking blood thinners for a period of time before surgery. If it does happen, the staff are trained to deal with it.<br/>
Another risk is the AV node and WPW pathway being in close proximity to one another. Sometimes in this case the AV node might be damaged when trying to ablate the WPW pathway. If this happens the heart will be fine; it will still keep beating as it’s being paced by one of the catheter leads. A pacemaker will be fitted to pace the heart after surgery. This may add limitations to your daily life. This possibility will be discussed with you by your surgeon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fluid buildup around the chest cavity can sometimes happen if the wall of punctured. In this case a line will be fed in and the fluid will be drained. <br/>
<br/>
Infection is always a possibility with any surgery, keep the wound area clean to avoid this.<br/>
<br/>
Death can never be ruled out of any surgery but the risk is incredibly low for this procedure.
