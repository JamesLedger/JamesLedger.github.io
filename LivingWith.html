			<b>Emergency treatment of WPW</b><br/>
If the dangerous heart rate fails to terminate by itself within, medical intervention is usually required. There are two main methods that is used in A+E to treat this:<br/>
* Drugs<br/>
* Cardioversion<br/>
<br/>
Drugs used to be seen as the first line of controlling a non-terminating WPW flare up, but in recent years this has become discouraged as research has found the medication to have adverse effects and in cases can make the situation worse.<br/>
<br/>
The safest and most effective emergency treatment is cardioversion. In Cardioversion, the patient is lightly sedated until they lose consciousness, conducting pads are placed onto the chest area and the heart is shocked into the correct heart rhythm. This method is quick and relatively painless due to the sedation. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White</b> <br/>
There are currently two main treatments of WPW; a drug that can suppress the effects of the excess pathways and Catheter ablation surgery which is more commonly adopted.<br/>
<br/>
The drug method is good at suppressing some cases of WPW, however the medication requires it to be taken every day and it’s not 100% effective in blocking all signals from going through these extra pathways so there is still the chance that you can have a flare up, it’s just that the likelihood is reduced. It’s effectiveness also depends on placement of the pathway in the heart, it’s conductivity and how many pathways there are.<br/>
<br/>
Catheter Ablation surgery is the most widely accepted and effective way of treating WPW. In the surgery, tiny probes are sent through the veins up into the heart where they then locate the problematic excess pathways and destroy them using concentrated radio frequency. If successful, the patient is left WPW free. However, it may take multiple surgeries depending on pathway location and how many pathways need to be destroyed.<br/>
The surgery is usually quite fast (around 2 hours) and patients can go home the next day.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Life with WPW</b><br/>
<br/>

WPW Attack Triggers
While WPW can flare up on its own, there are know triggers that can influence the condition.<br/>
* Caffeinated products such as chocolate, coffee, tea, cola and energy drinks.<br/>
* Exercise<br/>
* Stress/Anxiety/extreme excitement<br/>
* Drugs<br/>
* Smoking<br/>
<br/>
Anything that can cause an elevation of heart rate such as stimulants can increase likelihood of a flare up. Because of this it is encouraged to limit or cut out caffeine, emotional stress and drugs from your lifestyle until the condition is under control. A healthy controlled diet and lifestyle is recommended.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Out and About</b><br/>
You should be able to live life fairly normally with the condition (especially if it’s asymptomatic), however it may be wise to purchase a medical ID bracelet that lists you have WPW (plus any additional medical conditions) as a precaution. This is so that if you are found unconscious, medical staff can be alerted to the fact you have WPW and factor that in when assessing how to treat you. It makes the responders job more straightforward and lets you get treated faster. <br/>
It may also be helpful to have a clear photograph of your last ECG reading saved to your phone for future reference. It may prove useful when explaining to medical staff. <br/>
<br/>
If you are feeling weak or unwell, don’t be afraid of going into a shop or a place to sit down. Make the staff aware of your condition and that you are feeling unwell. That way they know what’s going on so if worst happens, they’re prepared to get you help. It may also helpful to locate the nearest Automatic Emergency Difibulator (AED) in the area, just as a precaution. <br/>
<br/>
Tempreture extremes can put stress on the heart, avoid exercising in hot and cold environments so your heart doesn’t have to work harder to regulate body temperature. <br/>
<br/>
When traveling abroad, please consider the points listed above and take note of emergency numbers and healthcare in the country you are visiting.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Driving and WPW</b><br/>
In the UK it is required that you alert the DVLA that you have Wolff Parkinson White as there is the possibility that you can become unconscious while behind the wheel. <br/>
For more information please consult the DVLA website: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome-and-driving">  https://www.gov.uk/wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome-and-driving  </a></li> <br/>
<br/>
<b>Pregnancy and WPW</b><br/>
A fair amount of women get diagnosed during pregnancy due to the stress and hormonal changes causing the WPW symptoms to surface. <br/>
