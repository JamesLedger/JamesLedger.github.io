This Project was made for our client kelly stanford to help raise awareness and provide information for wolff parkinson white syndrome
We aimed to make a website that would provide information about wolff parkinson white syndrome that was both easy to understand and useful for people suffering or that have loved ones suffering from the syndrome
we used information provided by our client(someone that suffered from wpw herself) from leading experts in the field
We found that most people hadnt even heard of the syndrome and that alot of the time will not be diaginosed as doctors often dont check for it
and that the information we could find on the internet was either not enough or basically said it wasnt a big deal which isnt true.
we were unable to make it fully adaptiable 

This project is about spreading information about Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome as a lot of Information provided on the internet is either lacking or make it seem like it isn't dangerous. We did this project for our client Kelly Stanford someone that has had Wolff Parkinson White syndrome herself and found the information she was provided misleading.
Our aims for the project was to make a website that clearly provided information that would help people with it and people that have loved ones with it.
We were able to make a webpage with information provided by our client that she got from leading heart surgeons and lay it out in an easy to understand format.
